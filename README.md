## Accessing the Uniswap Interface

To access the Uniswap Interface, use an IPFS gateway link from the
[latest release](https://github.com/1Hive/uniswap-interface/releases/latest),
or visit [baoswap.xyz](https://baoswap.xyz).

## Listing a token

Bao uses token lists, which are community managed lists.

## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Run

```bash
yarn start
```

### Configuring the environment (optional)

To have the interface default to a different network when a wallet is not connected:

1. Make a copy of `.env` named `.env.local`
2. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID` to `"{YOUR_NETWORK_ID}"`
3. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to e.g. `"https://{YOUR_NETWORK_ID}.infura.io/v3/{YOUR_INFURA_KEY}"`

Note that the interface only works on testnets where both
[Uniswap V2](https://uniswap.org/docs/v2/smart-contracts/factory/) and
[multicall](https://github.com/makerdao/multicall) are deployed.
The interface will not work on other networks.
